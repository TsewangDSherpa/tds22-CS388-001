# CS388-001: Android Development Class
# This is the main page for my CS388 Android Development Class (tds22-CS388-001)


Welcome to the repository for the CS388 Android Development class. This repository contains all the necessary materials for the course, including labs and projects that I complete.

## Repository Structure

Each lab and project will be organized into its own dedicated folder within this repository. Here's a breakdown of how the content is structured:

- **Labs**: Each lab will have its own folder named `LabX`, where `X` represents the lab number. Inside these folders, you'll find all the files and instructions related to that specific lab.
  
- **Projects**: Each project will be organized into folders named `ProjectX`, where `X` represents the project number. Each project folder will include the project's requirements, starter code, and any related resources.

## Folder Layout

- **`Labs/`**  
  This directory contains folders for each lab assignment. For example:
  - `Labs/Lab1/` - Contains files for Lab 1
  - `Labs/Lab2/` - Contains files for Lab 2

- **`Projects/`**  
  This directory contains folders for each project assignment. For example:
  - `Projects/Project1/` - Contains files for Project 1
  - `Projects/Project2/` - Contains files for Project 2

## How to Navigate

1. **Locate the appropriate folder**: Depending on whether you're looking for lab or project materials, navigate to the corresponding folder (`Labs/` or `Projects/`).

2. **Open the relevant sub-folder**: Inside the `Labs/` or `Projects/` directory, open the folder that corresponds to the specific lab or project you are working on.

3. **Access files and instructions**: Each lab or project folder will contain necessary files, code, and instructions for completing the assignment.

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues or have questions about the labs or projects, please refer to the [Course Documentation](#) or reach out to the course instructor.

Happy coding and best of luck with your Android Development class!
